## My process

- Think and built the design with HTML and CSS.
- Access all the div's and id's with Javascript that we will need to manipulate to show the information.
- First create a function for  random superheros and apply the logic and fetch the url provided by the API using the access token.
- Then create a function for the searched superheros and apply the logic.
- Then using the accessed div's and id manipulate them and show the required information that are fetched through an API.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Javascript
